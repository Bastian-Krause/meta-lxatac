Subject: [PATCH] libdt: prefer first found disk when looking for block devices
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Recent rework introduced a regression for state located in the eMMC
user area described by DT fixed partitions. Whereas before, the first
device with type "disk" was taken, dt-utils will now iterate over all
devices to try to find a matching GPT partition. If it doesn't find any,
it will instead take the last device with type "disk", which will be the
second boot partition for eMMC devices leading barebox-state to access
/dev/mmcblkXboot1 instead of /dev/mmcblkX.

Let's fix this regression by restoring the old behavior of preferring the
first disk. This may not be totally future proof, but it worked ok for
years and a better solution can always be added later with a regular
release.
